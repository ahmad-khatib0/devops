# Note that, by default, the number of tests Go will run in parallel is equal to how many CPUs you have on 
  your computer. So if you only have one CPU, then by default, the tests will still run serially, rather than 
  in parallel. You can override this setting by setting the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or by passing the -parallel 
  argument to the go test command. For example, to force Go to run up to two tests in parallel, you would run the following:
$ go test -v -timeout 30m -parallel 2

# Now you can start iterating on the hello-world-app module, and each time you make a change, you can rerun the tests,
  but this time, direct them to skip not only the teardown stages but also the mysql module deploy stage 
  (because mysql is still running) so that the only things that execute are deploy app and the validations for
  the hello-world-app module:

$ SKIP_teardown_db=true SKIP_teardown_app=true SKIP_deploy_db=true go test -timeout 30m -run 'TestHelloWorldAppStageWithStages'
    (...)

# Notice how fast each of these test runs is now: instead of waiting 10 to 15 minutes after every change, you can 
    try out new changes in 10 to 60 seconds (depending on the change). Given that you’re likely to rerun these stages 
    dozens or even hundreds of times during development, the time savings can be massive. Once the hello-world-app 
    module changes are working the way you expect, it’s time to clean everything up. Run the tests once more, this 
    time skipping the deploy and validation stages so that only the teardown stages are executed:
    
$ SKIP_deploy_db=true SKIP_deploy_app=true SKIP_validate_app=true go test -timeout 30m -run 'TestHelloWorldAppStageWithStages'
    (...)
    The 'SKIP_deploy_db' environment variable is set, so skipping stage 'deploy_db'.

    The 'SKIP_teardown_db' environment variable is not set, so executing stage 'teardown_db'.
    (...)
    PASS ok terraform-up-and-running 340.02s

Using test stages lets you get rapid feedback from your automated tests, dramatically increasing the speed and 
  quality of iterative development. It won’t make any difference in how long tests take in your CI environment, but 
  the impact on the development environment is huge.
